Alternate List Syntax
---------------------

-
    Lists may start on the next line after
-
    In all cases, the first text determines
    the level of indentation
-
  As such, this is a paragraph.

    Yet, this is considered to be blockquote.

  And this is normal text again
-
    But with a more indented first line,
    this same level is a normal paragraph
  and this is not part of the list (warning)
